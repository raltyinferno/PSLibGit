Postscript Library Use Documentation:

**********************
Object Creation
**********************

-Basic unit of distance in postscript is 1/72 inches

Shapes are created via constructor call, with parameters for their sizes
all shapes are drawn around the current origin

----------------
Basic Shapes
----------------

-Circle(Circle name(rad))
ex: Circle c1(5)
creates a circle with radius of 5 units

-Square(Sqaure name(edge length))
ex: Square s1(5)
creates a square with sides of length 5 units

-Rectange(Rectange name(height,width))
ex: Rectange r1(2,3)
creates rectangle 2 units high and 3 units wide

-Triangle(Triangle name(edge length))
ex: Triange t1(5)
creates a regular triangle with edges 5 units long

-Polygon(Polygon name(sides,edge length)
ex: Polygon p1(10,5)
creates a decagon with sides 5 units long

-Nice(Nice name())
ex: Nice n1
creates an alien head thing

-Spacer(Spacer name(height,width))
ex: Spacer sp1(2,5)
Draws nothing, but creates an object 2 units high and 5 units wide

----------------
Modified Shapes
----------------

-Rotated Shape(Rotater name(angle, pointer to shape to rotate))
ex: Rotater rot1(45,&s1)
Rotates s1 by 45 degrees

-Scaled Shape(Scaler name(x scale, y scale, shape to be scaled))
ex: Scaler sca1(.5, 2, &c1)
Makes c1 half as wide and twice as tall

----------------
Compound Shapes
----------------

-Layer Shapes(Layerd name = {list of pointers to shapes})
ex: Layered l1 = {&c1,&s1,&r1}
Creates a shape with c1, s1, and r1 centered on the same point

**NOTE:STACKED SHAPES WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY WITH ROTATED SHAPES**(they can however be rotated properly)
-Horizontal Stack(Horizontal name = {list of pointers to shapes})
ex: Horizontal h1 = {&c1,&s1,&r1}
Creates a shape with c1, s1, and, r1 lined up left to right centered around the same y

-Vertical Stack(Vertical name = {list of pointers to shapes})
ex: Vertical v2 = {&c1,&s1,&r1}
Creates a shape with c1, s1, and, r1 lined up top to bottom centered around the same x



******************
Usage
******************

To convert from inches to postscript default units use the inches function
ex: inch(1)
ex: Circle c1(inch(3))
Creates a circle with a radius of 3 inches

Included in the library is a Document class for creating postscript files.

To create a new postscript file create a new Document object with the name of the output file
ex: Document d1("pretty_picture.ps")

in order to add shapes to the document use the stream insertion operator << and the shape's draw function
ex: d1 << c1.draw()

All shapes are drawn around the origin, which by default is at 0,0 the bottom left corner of the page.
To change where shapes are drawn use the setOrigin function, the first parameter being x, the second y.
ex: d1 << setOrigin(72,72)
Keep in mind that this is relative, so doing setOrigin(72,72) twice in a row will set the origin to 144, 144

Once you have drawn everything you want on the page to show it use the endPage fucntion of the Document
ex: d1.endPage()
afterwhich you can either keep adding shapes, which will now be on a new page, or output to the file with the
print function
ex: d1.print()

***************
Sample Program
***************

#include "Shape.h"

int main()
{
	Document d1("pretty_picture.ps");
	Circle c1(inch(1));
	Square s1(inch(2));
	Layered l1 = {&c1,&s1};
	Horizontal h1 = {&l1,&l1};
	Vertical v1 = {&h1, &h1};
	Rotater r1(45,&v1);
	
	d1 << setOrigin(inch(3), inch(3));
	d1 << r1.draw();
	
	d1.endPage();
	d1.print();
}
